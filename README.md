==========
This is an experiment to connect my Ubuntu machine to one or many
Apple TVs. It includes scanning the network, sending a picture or fake-mirroring.
Mirroring is achieved by taking a screenshot with scrot and sending these pictures
to the devices at 1fps.

## Requirements
- [Scrot](http://linuxbrit.co.uk/scrot/)
- [PyQt4](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PyQt)
